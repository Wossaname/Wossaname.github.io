### *But why?*
Just a random Idea me and my friends had. We had been theorycrafting builds for a couple of days now and realized we would need backup builds to come up with. We came with this idea instead :P

### How?
Simply load the page and let RNGesus work the magic for you ! It will automatically select from 2 to 4 keystones that you must take. It will also give you a spell that you must use in your build !

### Todo
* Add images for Keystones (if possible)
* Add images for main skills
* Add keystone and skills info with an hover tooltip
